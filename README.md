# PRODIGY-CS-4
A simple keylogger

## 1.  Keylogger Class: 
   - The `Keylogger` class is defined to handle keylogging functionality.
   - It initializes an empty log to store pressed keys.

## 2.  Methods: 
   - `append_to_log(string)`: Appends the given string (representing a key) to the log.
   - `process_key_press(key)`: Processes key presses. If the key is a character, it converts it to a string. If it's a special key (like space), it handles it accordingly.
   - `report()`: Prints the accumulated log and resets it. It also schedules itself to run every 5 seconds.
   - `start()`: Sets up a keyboard listener using the `pynput` library. It starts listening for key presses and calls the `report()` method.

## 3.  Usage: 
   - both 'keylogger.py' and 'key_logger_start' both files should be in same folder because to run key_logger_start module keylogger is important there is no inbuilt module in python
   - to start the keylogger run the key_logger_start.py file then for every 5 seconds, the log's of key stocks will we be stored in the keylog.txt file


## NOTICE: Remember to handle the security implications of keylogging carefully, as it can be misused. Ensure that you have proper authorization and legitimate use cases when implementing such functionality.
